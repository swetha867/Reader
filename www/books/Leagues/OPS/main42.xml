From Cape Horn to the Amazon</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>How I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the
Canadian had carried me there. But I breathed, I inhaled the
vivifying sea-air. My two companions were getting drunk with the
fresh particles. The other unhappy men had been so long without
food, that they could not with impunity indulge in the simplest
aliments that were given them. We, on the contrary, had no end to
restrain ourselves; we could draw this air freely into our lungs,
and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that filled us with this
keen enjoyment.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Conseil, "how delightful this oxygen is! Master need
not fear to breathe it. There is enough for everybody."</p>
<p>Ned Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide enough to
frighten a shark. Our strength soon returned, and, when I looked
round me, I saw we were alone on the platform. The foreign seamen
in the Nautilus were contented with the air that circulated in the
interior; none of them had come to drink in the open air.</p>
<p>The first words I spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness
to my two companions. Ned and Conseil had prolonged my life during
the last hours of this long agony. All my gratitude could not repay
such devotion.</p>
<p>"My friends," said I, "we are bound one to the other for ever,
and I am under infinite obligations to you."</p>
<p>"Which I shall take advantage of," exclaimed the Canadian.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" said Conseil.</p>
<p>"I mean that I shall take you with me when I leave this infernal
Nautilus."</p>
<p>"Well," said Conseil, "after all this, are we going right?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "for we are going the way of the sun, and here
the sun is in the north."</p>
<p>"No doubt," said Ned Land; "but it remains to be seen whether he
will bring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, that
is, into frequented or deserted seas."</p>
<p>I could not answer that question, and I feared that Captain Nemo
would rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of
Asia and America at the same time. He would thus complete the tour
round the submarine world, and return to those waters in which the
Nautilus could sail freely. We ought, before long, to settle this
important point. The Nautilus went at a rapid pace. The polar
circle was soon passed, and the course shaped for Cape Horn. We
were off the American point, March 31st, at seven o'clock in the
evening. Then all our past sufferings were forgotten. The
remembrance of that imprisonment in the ice was effaced from our
minds. We only thought of the future. Captain Nemo did not appear
again either in the drawing-room or on the platform. The point
shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by the lieutenant,
showed me the exact direction of the Nautilus. Now, on that
evening, it was evident, to, my great satisfaction, that we were
going back to the North by the Atlantic. The next day, April 1st,
when the Nautilus ascended to the surface some minutes before noon,
we sighted land to the west. It was Terra del Fuego, which the
first navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that
rose from the natives' huts. The coast seemed low to me, but in the
distance rose high mountains. I even thought I had a glimpse of
Mount Sarmiento, that rises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea,
with a very pointed summit, which, according as it is misty or
clear, is a sign of fine or of wet weather. At this moment the peak
was clearly defined against the sky. The Nautilus, diving again
under the water, approached the coast, which was only some few
miles off. From the glass windows in the drawing-room, I saw long
seaweeds and gigantic fuci and varech, of which the open polar sea
contains so many specimens, with their sharp polished filaments;
they measured about 300 yards in length — real cables, thicker than
one's thumb; and, having great tenacity, they are often used as
ropes for vessels. Another weed known as velp, with leaves four
feet long, buried in the coral concretions, hung at the bottom. It
served as nest and food for myriads of crustacea and molluscs,
crabs, and cuttlefish. There seals and otters had splendid repasts,
eating the flesh of fish with sea-vegetables, according to the
English fashion. Over this fertile and luxuriant ground the
Nautilus passed with great rapidity. Towards evening it approached
the Falkland group, the rough summits of which I recognised the
following day. The depth of the sea was moderate. On the shores our
nets brought in beautiful specimens of seaweed, and particularly a
certain fucus, the roots of which were filled with the best mussels
in the world. Geese and ducks fell by dozens on the platform, and
soon took their places in the pantry on board.</p>
<p>When the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from the
horizon, the Nautilus sank to between twenty and twenty-five yards,
and followed the American coast. Captain Nemo did not show himself.
Until the 3rd of April we did not quit the shores of Patagonia,
sometimes under the ocean, sometimes at the surface. The Nautilus
passed beyond the large estuary formed by the Uraguay. Its
direction was northwards, and followed the long windings of the
coast of South America. We had then made 1,600 miles since our
embarkation in the seas of Japan. About eleven o'clock in the
morning the Tropic of Capricorn was crossed on the thirty-seventh
meridian, and we passed Cape Frio standing out to sea. Captain
Nemo, to Ned Land's great displeasure, did not like the
neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for we went at a
giddy speed. Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind could
follow us, and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all
observation.</p>
<p>This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of
the 9th of April we sighted the most westerly point of South
America that forms Cape San Roque. But then the Nautilus swerved
again, and sought the lowest depth of a submarine valley which is
between this Cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast. This
valley bifurcates to the parallel of the Antilles, and terminates
at the mouth by the enormous depression of 9,000 yards. In this
place, the geological basin of the ocean forms, as far as the
Lesser Antilles, a cliff to three and a half miles perpendicular in
height, and, at the parallel of the Cape Verde Islands, another
wall not less considerable, that encloses thus all the sunk
continent of the Atlantic. The bottom of this immense valley is
dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a
picturesque aspect. I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts
that were in the library of the Nautilus — charts evidently due to
Captain Nemo's hand, and made after his personal observations. For
two days the desert and deep waters were visited by means of the
inclined planes. The Nautilus was furnished with long diagonal
broadsides which carried it to all elevations. But on the 11th of
April it rose suddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the
Amazon River, a vast estuary, the embouchure of which is so
considerable that it freshens the sea-water for the distance of
several leagues.</p>
